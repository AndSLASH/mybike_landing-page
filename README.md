# My BiKE Landing Page

This is my educational project â€” the **MYBIKE landing page**, created as part of my web development practice. Itâ€™s a single-page website for a fictional urban e-bike brand. The goal was not only to design a visually appealing layout but also to apply modern layout and styling techniques.

ðŸ”§ **Technologies and approaches I used:**

- **HTML + SCSS** â€” for structuring and styling the page. I used **SCSS** to make the code more modular and readable.
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid** â€” for building a flexible, responsive layout and aligning elements effectively.
- **Mobile First** â€” I started with the mobile version and progressively enhanced it for tablets and desktops.
- **Responsive Design** â€” the layout adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Hover effects and animations** â€” added for better user interaction and a more dynamic interface.

ðŸš² **The main content of the site includes:**

- Presentation of three e-bike models.
- Key product features like auto unlock, GPS tracking, removable battery, and hydraulic disc brakes.
- Contact information and a call-to-action section.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of modern layout techniques, improve my responsive design skills, and get more comfortable using both Grid and Flexbox. In the future, I plan to add JavaScript functionality (like model switching, a dynamic gallery, or a basic contact form).
